# My dotfiles repo

I use [Homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick) to manage my dotfiles.

## Installation

### Homesick

1. Install Homesick with `gem install homesick`
1. Clone this castle with `homesick clone natemccurdy/dotfiles`
1. Create the symlinks with `homesick symlink dotfiles`

### Fonts

Install Awesome patched fonts to make vim-airline happy:

1. Download and install an Awesome patched font:
  * <https://github.com/gabrielelana/awesome-terminal-fonts/raw/patching-strategy/patched/Inconsolata%2BAwesome.ttf>
1. Switch iTerm2 to use that font for both **Font** and **Non ASCII Font**
